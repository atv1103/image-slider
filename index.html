                    <div class="slide-item__description">The red desert sands of Monument Valley, where sandstone rock
                        formations tower above valleys and mesas, have been featured in films by John Ford and other
                        legendary Western directors for years. The valley is sacred to the Indigenous people of the
                        Navajo Nation Reservation, so be respectful of the tribal communities when you visit. You can
                        explore this ancient site by car on a 17-mile scenic road, or experience the spectacular terrain
                        on an Indigenous-led tour such as with Three Sisters Navajo Guided Tours.</div>

                    <div class="slide-item__description">The landscape of Wadi Rum in southern Jordan fuses natural and
                        cultural history. Rock carvings and other archaeological remains attest to 12,000 years of human
                        life in this roughly 450-square-mile desert area, whose natural features include arches, gorges,
                        cliffs and more. Today, locals welcome tourists to their goat-hair tents and lead camel rides to
                        see the area's desert sunsets, mile-high sandstone pillars and ancient petroglyphs, sharing
                        their culture along the way.</div>

                    <div class="slide-item__description">In the heart of Banff National Park lies Lake Louise, a
                        turquoise glacial lake surrounded by towering evergreens and snowclad summits. During the summer
                        months, hike its trails to find a hidden waterfall or visit its two historic teahouses. And in
                        winter, bundle up and join the crowds to ice skate on the lake under the stars or hit the slopes
                        at Lake Louise Ski Resort. Keep in mind that parking here is limited, so your best bet is
                        booking a shuttle or using public transportation to get to the lake.</div>

                    <div class="slide-item__description">As the Grand Canyon's name suggests, this natural wonder is
                        impressive, measuring 278 river miles long; it has a maximum width of 18 miles from rim to rim
                        and an average depth of 1 mile. To avoid crowds of tourists in Grand Canyon National Park, skip
                        the South Rim and head to the North Rim – but keep in mind that this area only permits
                        backcountry hikers in winter, while the South Rim is open year-round. For the grandest thrills,
                        join a licensed river rafting tour or visit the Skywalk, which is the Hualapai Tribe's
                        vertigo-inducing, glass-floored attraction that projects 70 feet from Grand Canyon West's rim.

                        understand why this unusually steep, conical mountain in West Iceland is one of the country's
                        most photographed natural wonders. Consisting of sedimentary rock layers formed by ancient
                        glaciers, Kirkjufell is best seen from one of the black sand beaches below or from the walking
                        path that circles its base. Another iconic attraction in the area, Kirkjufellsfoss, is one of
                        Iceland's most beautiful waterfalls. Multiple accommodation options are available in the nearby
                        town of Grundarfjörður.</div>

                        acres of natural beauty. Travelers can enjoy hiking through valleys, kayaking around glaciers,
                        spotting puma and other rare wildlife, and more.</div>
